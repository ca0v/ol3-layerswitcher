# OpenLayers 3 LayerSwitcher

Grouped layer list control for an OL3 map.

All layers should have a `title` property and base layers should have a `type` property set to `base`. Group layers (`ol.layer.Group`) can be used to visually group layers together. See [examples/layerswitcher.js](examples/layerswitcher.js) for usage.
